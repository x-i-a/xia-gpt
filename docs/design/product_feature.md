## Product feature
### Highlights
* Much like AutoGPT, they can produce complex outputs from simple instructions using a prompt/answer mechanism.
* A little more than MetaGPT, every prompt/answer is executed by either an AI Agent or a human. The AI Agent operates in a manner similar to humans and offers a range of settings.
* When a task becomes too complex for the current agent, it is escalated to a more capable agent or even a human.
* Integration of validation and review processes enhances the accuracy of each task. When using GitLab to hold work, validation is facilitated through the CI/CD pipeline.
* All conversations are meticulously organized. When using GitLab for storage, they are categorized as Group, Project, Issue, Milestone, Thread, and Note.
* All expenses are accounted for. When stored in GitLab, costs are represented through time tracking.
* Effortlessly configurable to cover all aspects and accomplish every task.

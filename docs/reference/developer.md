OpenAI GPT4's response of the following question:
* what is the world's average pay per hour for a developer ?

## Conclusion
**€13.36/hr** => 2.7s/€0.01

## Payment Estimation:

- **US:** $90,000 average => $90,000/2000 = $45/hr => 45 * 0.85 = €38.25/hr
- **Western Europe:** €57,500 average => €57,500/2000 = €28.75/hr
- **Eastern Europe:** $30,000 average => $30,000/2000 = $15/hr => 15 * 0.85 = €12.75/hr
- **India:** ₹7,00,000 average => ₹7,00,000/2000 = ₹350/hr => 350 * 0.011 = €3.85/hr
- **Latin America:** $22,500 average => $22,500/2000 = $11.25/hr => 11.25 * 0.85 = €9.56/hr
- **Africa:** $12,500 average => $12,500/2000 = $6.25/hr => 6.25 * 0.85 = €5.31/hr
- **Australia:** €82,500 (after conversion) average => €82,500/2000 = €41.25/hr

## Population estimates around 2021:

- **US:** 331 million
- **Western Europe (Germany, UK, France combined):** ~210 million (a rough estimate; other Western European countries are not included)
- **Eastern Europe:** Difficult to determine without specific countries but let's estimate ~150 million for the primary countries.
- **India:** 1.366 billion
- **Latin America (again, hard without specific countries):** ~650 million (overestimation because not all are developers)
- **Africa:** 1.3 billion (overestimation because not all countries are represented)
- **Australia:** 25 million

## Weighted hourly pay:

- **US:** €38.25 * 331/(331+210+150+1366+650+1300+25) = €6.48
- **Western Europe:** €28.75 * 210/4000 = €1.53
- **Eastern Europe:** €12.75 * 150/4000 = €0.48
- **India:** €3.85 * 1366/4000 = €1.31
- **Latin America:** €9.56 * 650/4000 = €1.56
- **Africa:** €5.31 * 1300/4000 = €1.74
- **Australia:** €41.25 * 25/4000 = €0.26

**Summing up the above:** €6.48 + €1.53 + €0.48 + €1.31 + €1.56 + €1.74 + €0.26 = **€13.36/hr**

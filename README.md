# xia-gpt: Human-AI collaboration for General AI
## Product purpose
* A collaborative workspace where human and AI contributions are equally valued.
* A framework designed to simplify tasks. Adequate context and strong inferential capabilities ensure task success.
* Continuously evolving to decrease human involvement. Reaching 0% signifies the achievement of General AI.
* Highly configurable and compatible with all missions, not limited to just development tasks.

## Quick Start Prerequisite
* A gitlab account (free-tier compatible) with personal token. Could either be gitlab SaaS or self-manged instance.
* (Recommended) Openai API Key. When an API key is not provided, you can still complete all tasks manually with the assistance of ChatGPT.


## Quick Start - GitHub Actions


## Product feature
* Much like AutoGPT, they can produce complex outputs from simple instructions using a prompt/answer mechanism.
* Every prompt/answer is executed by either an AI Agent or a human. The AI Agent operates in a manner similar to humans and offers a range of settings.
* When a task becomes too complex for the current agent, it is escalated to a more capable agent or even a human.
* Integration of validation and review processes enhances the accuracy of each task. When using GitLab, validation is facilitated through the CI/CD pipeline.
* All conversations are meticulously organized. When using GitLab for storage, they are categorized as Group, Project, Issue, Milestone, Thread, and Note.
* All expenses are accounted for. When stored in GitLab, costs are represented through time tracking.
